## Professional Experience

### Barrack, Rodos & Bacine
#### Philadelphia PA, June 2008&mdash;Present
Barrack, Rodos & Bacine is a law firm that monitors the investment portfolios of domestic and international public pension funds for exposure to losses in securities litigation suits.

**Senior Data Analyst**: My primary responsibilities included creating web tools that checked for errors in data delivered to clients, create and automate custom reports for attorneys and support staff, manage the monthly download and importing of transaction and holdings data for over seventy clients, and oversaw a team of data analysts that generated loss information for all clients in hundreds of class action lawsuits per year.

Most recently a growing portion of my responsibilities have been to use my decade of experience as a data analyst to identify portions of the firm workflow that has exposure to user error and eliminating it with web tools that alert and warn users when numbers are out of bounds or a warning is detected in the database.

**Accomplishments**

- Created a intranet website that collected a half dozen different tools used by employees at the firm.
 
  The server backend, written in Laravel, unified multiple databases that held client information, case information, and client transaction data. With that data unified it could be exposed as a JSON API to create easier to maintain client-side tools.
  
  The client-side tools that used the data were largely created with Vue.js and were used to validate client transaction data, add information to the client facing website, monitor and report on errors detected in client information, run and download custom reports generated as Excel files.

- Within a tight deadline I was able to adapt our client data website to a new public facing design. This process included creating mockups in Adobe Photoshop and then rapidly implementing those designs through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the PERL backend.
